# Next &middot; Sanity &middot; Blog

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) &nbsp; <= &nbsp; That's how we started. And, a fragment left from the original README

## I've Come a Little Ways

Sanity is tied to it. I've change this same code from an markdown blog, to a sanity backend running SSR, and then to SSG. I've also tweaked the style enough that it looks pretty good, even on the mobile. I even build my own React YouTube component! Hopefully in a week or two, this will be a convenient starter for any Next app.

If you can't tell.. I'm sold on the React Bandwagon. Though, I still have tons left to learn!
