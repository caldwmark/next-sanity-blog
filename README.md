# Next &middot; Sanity &middot; Blog

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) &nbsp; &lArr; &nbsp; That's how we started. And, a fragment left from the original README

There is a couple sources I merged together, that helped me get this project started. I should add here, when I find them.

## I've Come a Little Ways

Next wrapped around React, connected to Sanity. Then, formed into my blog. So far it's doing pretty dang good. Check out my [lighthouse scores](https://web.dev/measure/?gclid=CjwKCAjw6fyXBhBgEiwAhhiZsomBRG6o3zyMvSZGg-MWoDmu2N2J25HYLMBI9DSUvRZUmHrZ13oLdxoC1v4QAvD_BwE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bearcountrypublishing.com).
Did I mention this app installs with <span style="color:lime"> 0 </span> vulnerabilities? The best part, it's all FREE!

If you can't tell.. I'm sold on the React Bandwagon. Though, I still have tons left to learn!
