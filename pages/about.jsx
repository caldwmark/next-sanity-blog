                    Though, likely soon, from Docker containers on a VPS.
                    Because, we love Docker. This is complicated stuff, people!
                    Don&apos;t be surprised if I break it a few times ðŸ˜„

                    It is off to a good start. I have finally settled on the
                    perfect combination for me. However, there is a whole lot of
                    work left to do before this is complete. So, stay tuned!

                    First up is the font. This poppins is a little hard for me
                    to read. We also want the font hosted by us and not google.
                    I don&apos;t want to have any more cross origin cookies than
                    neccessary. There is already a YouYube cookie, as they host
                    the videos on the blog pages.

                    More meta is also needed. It will probably be the next react
                    component to build. Then probably work on something more
                    noticeable or interactive.

                    The hardest ding we took at lighthouse was on performance.
                    Seeing yellow means we should work on that issue soon, too.
                    We want 100s across the board, if not we at least want all
                    green.
